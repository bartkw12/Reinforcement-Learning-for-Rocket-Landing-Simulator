# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Rocket-Landing-Simulator

Three implementations of RL agents to solve the LunarLander rocket trajectory optimization problem from the Gymnasium Python library.

Link to find the LunarLander-Gymnasium Python library:

*Note: there is a very common problem with Box2D environments (such as LunarLander) in Gymnasium on Windows typically involving missing C++ build tools and dependencies. 
I did not run into any issues using Linux, but if you do use Windows here is a great video that solves the problem:
